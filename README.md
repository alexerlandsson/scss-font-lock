# SCSS Font Lock
This is a SCSS mixin used to create CSS locks for responsive typography. To make in convenient to use it allows you to use both px and em as units and if anything goes wrong, it will let you know during the compile using scss @warn.

**Demo: [https://alexerlandsson.github.io/scss-font-lock/demo/demo.html](https://alexerlandsson.github.io/scss-font-lock/demo/demo.html)**

## What is a CSS lock?
A CSS lock is a technique used to smooth change the font size depending on viewport width between to breakpoints.

## How to use?
Add the mixin in your SCSS file and use `@include` to include it to where you want it to be used.

```scss
@include scss-font-lock($min-size, $max-size, $min-width, $max-width);
```

Change the variables to desired values in either `px` or `em`. Please not that the output will be presented in px. The mixin contains a calculation of em to px with the default font-size of 16px. However, you can change that base value by include another variable in the mixin with the new value. Example:

```scss
@include scss-font-lock($min-size, $max-size, $min-width, $max-width, 14px);
```

### Example
This example demonstrate a CSS lock where the font size will be 16px up to a vieport width of 375px and then scale up to 60px which locks at 1024px:

```scss
@include scss-font-lock(16px, 60px, 375px, 1024px);
```

## Variables
Variable 			| Description
--------------------| ----------------------------
$min-size			| Font minimum size. Will be displayed on viewport smaller than $min-width.
$max-size			| Font maximum size. Will be displayed on viewport larger than $max-width.
$min-width			| Breakpoint where the font reaches its minimal font size.
$max-width			| Breakpoint where the font reaches its maximum font size.
$base-font-size		| **Optional.** Base font size used to calculate values set in `em`. Default 16px if not passed into the mixin.

## Error handling
This mixin is built to handle errors. If variables are set it non-compatible units, it will let you know when you compile into css using SCSS @warn. Another feature is that the mixin will ignore an output on error and instead display an error message on top of the text.
